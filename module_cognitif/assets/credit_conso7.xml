                                    <item>There are plenty of "general" differences between loans and lines of credit. Bigger-ticket debts such as a house or car tend to be made through standard loans. Standard loans are more likely to be secured against an asset. Lines of credit tend to have higher rates of interest and smaller minimum payment amounts. Lines of credit usually create more immediate, larger impacts on consumer credit reports and credit scores. Closing costs, if any, are higher for loans than lines of credit on average.

Many loans also require a specific purpose; for instance, you take out a student loan to pay for higher education, you are granted a mortgage to buy a property, etc. Lines of credit, however, do not typically have a specific purchase purpose. Purchases can be made on a variety of items without the lender's approval, and no assets have to be appraised.

In this way, lines of credit represent a much more flexible borrowing tool.</item>

It guarantees you a preliminary offer of credit for any funding application with mandatory information: the date of the offer, the identity of the parties and any guarantees, the amount of credit and the terms of the contract.
This law gives you a cooling off period of 15 days from the issue date of the preliminary Offer of Credit. It should also be noted that the lender can not go back on his offer or modify during these 15 days.
Once signed offer, you also have a period of 14 days to retract. The withdrawal form must necessarily be part of the preliminary Offer of Credit on the copy of the contract for the customer.</item>

If you want to pay in advance more than € 10,000, you will have to pay compensation and its amount will depend on when you do this. So if you pay in advance your loan:
- More than a year before the end of the initial credit, your allowances will amount to 1% of its total.
- Less than a year before the end of the initial credit, your allownces will amount to 0.5% of its total.

In all cases these benefits may not exceed the amount of interest you should have paid until the credit.

Consumer credit is a type of credit used to purchase products and services, such as a car or a package holiday, without having to pay the full amount at once.

                                    <item>Credit cards and lines of credit are two familiar forms of revolving credit. Your credit limit does not change when you make payments on your revolving credit account. You can return to your account to borrow additional money as often as you want, as long as you do not exceed your maximum.
Because you are not borrowing a lump sum when the account is opened, there is no set payment plan with revolving credit. You are merely being granted the ability to borrow up to a certain amount. However, this flexibility often results in lower borrowing amounts and higher interest rates. Unsecured revolving credit account interest rates often range around 15-20% or more. The interest rate is rarely locked in, and creditors have the right to increase your rate if you fail to make payments.

                                    <item>Perhaps the most distinguishing features of an installment credit account are a predetermined length and an end date, which is sometimes referred to as the term of the loan. The loan agreement usually includes an amortization schedule, in which the principal is gradually reduced through installment payments over the course of several years.
Common installment loans include mortgages, auto loans, student loans and private personal loans. With each of these loans, you generally know how much your monthly payment is and how long you will be making payments. An additional credit application is required to borrow more money.

Installment credit is considered to be less dangerous to your credit score than revolving credit. 
Revolving credit is considered a more dangerous way to borrow than installment credit. An enormous part of your credit score is your revolving credit card utilization rate. Carrying high balances drags down your score.

 Indeed, this type of credit agreement is concluded for a period of one year, renewable annually. The lender has to state three months before the expiry of the credit agreement, the conditions for renewal or extension of the contract.
 You may refuse the proposed amendments or just express your refusal to renew with a registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt before the deadline. The special conditions of contract specify the notice.

Know that the termination of the credit agreement involves the repayment of sums due. In this case, the lender must provide a staggered payment of such sums. He can not demand full repayment of the sum in one go.

                                    <item>At any time, you can repay your advance loan fully or partially without compensation if the amount is less than or equal to 10 000. If you want to pay in advance more than € 10,000, you will have to pay compensation and its amount will depend on when you do this. So if you pay in advance your loan:
- More than a year before the end of the initial credit, your allowances will amount to 1% of its total.
- Less than a year before the end of the initial credit, your allownces will amount to 0.5% of its total.

In all cases these benefits may not exceed the amount of interest you should have paid until the credit.

The hire purchase is also called leasing. At the end of the lease, the borrower has the opportunity to acquire the property by paying the residual value.

The hire purchase concerns the acquisition of a vehicle (car or motorcycle) but it can however be used for other types of goods (computer equipment, for example).

The rental period generally varies between 24 months (2 years) and 72 months (6 years).
An initial contribution, corresponding to a security deposit is usually required. The amount varies according to the importance of good.
At the end of the rental period, the deposit is returned to you if you return the good, or it is deducted from the purchase price if you decide to keep it.

The hire purchase is a suitable solution for motorists regularly changing vehicles. It offers more flexibility because it allows drivers to not to bother with the constraints related to the sale of the vehicle. However, the total cost of the hire purchase is greater than the car credit.

- The risk is spread between borrowers: In case of death or total and irreversible disability of a borrower, the outstanding capital balance will be refunded only proportionally to the assured part. The allocation is decided by the co-borrowers at the signature of the contract.

Warning: the guarantee does not apply in a number of cases: for example, it does not cover employees in trial period or pre-retirement period, or cases of voluntary resignation, partial unemployment, or unemployment occurring at the end of a non-renewal of fixed-term contracts.
